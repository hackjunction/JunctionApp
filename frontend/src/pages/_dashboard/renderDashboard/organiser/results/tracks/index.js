                    Set the final, public results for each track here. These are
                    the results which will be visible in the project gallery,
                    provided that you have set it as public. You can drag and
                    rearrange projects within the "ranked" section of each track
                    to determine a rank for them. All projects left as unranked
                    will not have a public ranking attached to them. The
                    rankings for each track will be publicly displayed with the
