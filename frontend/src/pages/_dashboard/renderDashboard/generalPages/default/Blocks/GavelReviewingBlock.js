                The main winner of this event will be decided via
                peer-reviewing, which means participants will review each
                others' projects for the duration of the reviewing period.
                Sounds scary? Don't worry, checking out other people's projects
                is a ton of fun, and the reviewing process is explained in
                detail on the reviewing page!

                    This event is divided into {event.tracks.length} different
                    tracks - you can think of them as themes, and each team must
                    choose which track they are participating on when submitting
                    their project. The main winner is decided in two phases:
                    First, the winner of each track will be decided via
                    peer-reviewing. All {event.tracks.length} track winners will
                    then advance to the finals, and get to demo their project on
                    the main stage in the closing ceremony. The main prize
                    winner will then be decided with a traditional vote - each
                    participant can vote for their favorite project out of the
                    finalists, and the project with the most votes will be
                    crowned the winner of {event.name}!
